# Dice-Assignment1-Part3
This Assignment based on Docker. In this part we will do the Docker Volumes

● Create a new Docker volume named "my_volume". 

 `docker volume create my_volume`

my_volume

● Create a new Docker container using the "nginx" image and mount the "my_volume"
volume to the container's "/usr/share/nginx/html" directory.

● Copy the "index.html" file from your host machine to the "my_volume" volume using the
"docker cp" command. 

docker cp index.html new_nginx_container:/usr/share/nginx/html/
Successfully copied 2.05kB to new_nginx_container:/usr/share/nginx/html/

I created this using this command

docker run -d --name new_nginx_container -v my_volume:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 8080:80 nginx


● Verify that the "nginx" default page is accessible on your host machine at
http://localhost:8080.

Yes this is working in my host machine.

● Stop & remove the container

docker stop new_nginx_container 

new_nginx_container

docker rm new_nginx_container

new_nginx_container


● Create a new Docker container using the "httpd" image and mount the "my_volume"
volume to the container's "/usr/local/apache2/htdocs" directory. (4 marks)
● Verify that the "httpd" default page is accessible on your host machine at
http://localhost:8081

docker run -d --name httpd_container -v my_volume:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs -p 8081:80 httpd

dd60cb58a75f8d3ee80cf26a4f937c99f8f89b8a3a06dccccc5474dd7403c5ec

The default page is working.


● Copy the "about.html" file from your host machine to the "my_volume" volume using the
"docker cp" command.

docker cp about.html httpd_docker:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
Successfully copied 2.56kB to httpd_docker:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/

● Verify that the "about.html" file is accessible on your host machine at
http://localhost:8081/about.html.

Yes I verified its working & show the content of my `about.html`

● Stop and remove the container. 

docker stop httpd_docker 

httpd_docker

docker rm httpd_docker 

httpd_docker

● Verify that the "index.html" and "about.html" files are still available in the "my_volume"
volume. 

I run a temporary cntainer with the volume mount

docker run --rm -it -v my_volume:/mnt busybox

`ls /mnt`

docker run --rm -it -v my_volume:/mnt busybox

Unable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally

docker volume ls

DRIVER    VOLUME NAME

local     my_volume

docker volume rm my_volume 

my_volume

docker volume ls

DRIVER    VOLUME NAME

Now no volume is available.

● Create a README.md file and document your findings for each command. For each
command, provide a brief description of what it does, followed by the output and logs
generated by the command. Ensure that the README.md file is well-organized, easy to
read, and contains all necessary information. 

I created this README.md with mention step by step commands & its output.

● Push the codebase for the sample application to your GitHub repository (create a new
one for this part)

git status

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	about.html
	index.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


git add .

git commit -m "I compile the README.md"

git push origin main
